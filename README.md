# Aussies-Battler-Fighting-Stick
A 3D printable fighting stick that can comfortably mount both original MCA and the newer MCA 3D joysticks.   It also includes a mount for the classic japanese JLF and clone arcade joysticks.
It includes a comfortable curved outter palm rest to enable you to play for longer, unlike other square edge designs.

**ArtWork**

Several retro control panel artworks to adapt into your 3D printed results. Be it to print in vinyl, or place under perspex and screw / glue into your case.

**Project Background**

As part of learning more about 3D design, I wanted to make fighting stick (1p control panel) that would comfortably mount classic MCA joysticks (see also https://github.com/dekkit/Modern-Classic-Aussie-3D-Joystick).   One of the challenges with mounting this joystick, is that it typically mounted in a metal arcade panel of ~1mm in thickness.  As a result, this type of joystick can be  quite difficult to mount in wooden, plastic, and existing 3D printable designs without serious modification (acknowledingthat  versions of MCA did exist specifically for wooden panels, they are not easy to find).

I also wanted to design something with a lot of flexibility, particularly with different button configurations to become the ultimate DIY fighting stick.   So I went through the majory of button configurations on Slagcoin, dug through internet photos to find various button layouts that were fairly common in many arcades  (e.g. Neogeo, NES / Donkey Long etc etc) and where possible reproduce them in 3d design.

I've also made the height of the joystick approx 61MM, while many japanese joysticks and buttons do not need this height, many of the buttons found in many original arcade cabs can be quite long (particuarly the original MCA buttons used in LAI cabinets).  The heights used in this design will comfortably fit almost all button types.

If you're after a much smaller DIY control panel (and less configurable), have a look https://github.com/dekkit/Mini-Beat-em-up-Arcade-Sticks

While much of the artwork that was used on Australian arcade control panels was pretty terrible!   But given its what most of us locals grew up with, I felt compelled to recreate any artwork i could find online and design something that looks nice on a 1p control panel.  Sure it might not look badass as a print of your favourite fighting figure, but it offers a great sense of nostelgia and take up much less space in your room than a real LAI lowboy cabinet.  Check out the artwork folder for the list of repro designs.   If you create your own that you'd like to share here please get in contact. 


**Printer Settings**

Print with PLA or PETG, I used 15% infill which provided ample strength.
- No supports needed
- suggest to rotate prints so that playing surface is fact down on the 3d plate to get smoothest finish.

Note: This design consumes a lot of filament but the end result is a very strong durable fighting stick that you can walk, jump, on and possibly use to protect yourself. 


**Parts**

1 x MCA, MCA 3d, JLF or clone arcade stick (standard holes)
4 x Arcade joystick mounting bolts (or an equivalent from hardware shop) - these are easily purchased cheaply via ebay/ali.
n x 30mm arcade buttons (or equivalent note: holes are 30mm depending on layout)
2 x 24mm arcade buttons (for Coin / Start)
1 x Encoder PCB (either purchase one from ebay/ali or make your own arduino based arcade encoder (ie plenty of cool projects like [Demonbite ](https://github.com/MickGyver/DaemonBite-Retro-Controllers-USB or see my other projects if you want to make a DIY arduino XBOX 360 for PC usb encoder https://github.com/dekkit/Arcade-to-Xbox360-PC-USB-Encoder/)
~10 x M3 self tapping screws (varying in length - suggest to buy a box of varying lengths). Alternatively you can use  glue to affix parts.
4 x rubber feet to avoid scratching tables etc.

8 x M3 self tapping screws for joining the base  (~8mm in length - suggest to buy a box of varying lengths to allow for printing differences ). Alternatively you can use various glue
4 x M3 long self tapping screws - these will be used to join the LEFT and RIGHT sections (min M3 x 25+mm length).  Alternative use a drill to enlargen holes if using larger size self taping screws or use glue to combine parts
4 x rubber feet to avoid scratching tables etc.
